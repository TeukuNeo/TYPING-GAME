    "It's just like him To wander off in the evergreen park Slowly searching For any sign of the ones he used to love He says he's got nothing left to live for He says hes got nothing left And this time I think you'll know",
    "When you've been fighting for it all your life You've been struggling to make things right That's how a superhero learns to fly Every day, every hour, turn the pain into power When you've fighting for it all your life You've been working every day and Night That's how a superhero learns to fly Every day, every hour, turn the pain into power All the hurt, all the lies All the tears that they cry When the moment is just right You see fire in their eyes Cause he's stronger than you know A heart of steel starts to grow",
    "So don't bet against me, I'm a man of my word. He is the greatest! Yes! I am the man this poem's about, I'll be champ of the world; there isn't a doubt.",
    "We need more light about each other. Light creates understanding, understanding creates love, love creates patience, and patience creates unity.",
    "Eye contact is also important throughout the course of the negotiation process. For example, if your opponent is putting pressure on you or raising their voice, your eyes should tell them: 'I know what you're doing and why you're doing it.' After this, however, it is important to look away; sustained eye contact could be seen as a challenge or provoke a flare-up of emotions. You may also come across instances of the negotiator playing the underdog. Everett Shostrom describes this term in his book Man, the Manipulator.15 In summary, in every person there are two dogs: the 'top dog' and the 'underdog'. The top dog puts on the pressure, as though making threats, whereas the underdog begs and demonstrates their own weakness, as though currying favour. Both are tricks. ",
    "I took out my journal and began to write what I was feeling and thinking. I wrote out the history of my condition, through my own lens and in my own words, for the first time. I listed which treatments had helped and which hadn't. I wrote down what I wanted and didn't want, what I was willing to sacrifice and what I wasn't, and what it would mean to me to escape the world of pain I felt trapped within. As the story of my health began to take shape on the page, I knew what I needed to do. I stood up abruptly, walked over to the receptionist, and asked for my complete patient record. She looked at me quizzically, but after I answered a few questions, she turned to her files and began making photocopies.",
    "In the mid-ninth century A.D., a young man named Michael III assumed the throne of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress Theodora, had been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus, had been mur dered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora and enthrone Michael had been Michael's unde, Bardas, a man of intelligence and ambition.

    "Crazy, oh, you make me wanna sway slow You push up on me, baby, you got me for days, oh, you do Just follow the beat of my drum It goes... Just follow the beat of my drum",
    "Memories consume Like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again I don't want to be the oneThe battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize That I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So, I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit tonight",
    "I wanted to create a kind of beginner's manual for this way of operating, so here's what I came up with: a book for people who hate the very idea of self-promotion. An alternative, if you will, to self promotion. I'm going to try to teach you how to think about your work as a never ending process, how to share your process in a way that attracts people who might be interested in what you do, and how to deal with the ups and downs of putting yourself and your work out in the world. If Steal Like an Artist was a book about stealing influence from other people, this book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from you.",
    "Some people find this idea depressing, but it fills me with hope. As the French writer André Gide put it, 'Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.' If we're free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it.",
    "One might argue that a book about code is somehow behind the times—that code is no longer the issue; that we should be concerned about models and requirements instead. Indeed some have suggested that we are close to the end of code. That soon all code will be generated instead of written. That programmers simply won’t be needed because business people will generate programs from specifications. Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.",
    "Do you ever feel like a plastic bag Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in? Do you ever feel already buried deep? Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thingDo you know that there's still a chance for you? 'Cause there's a spark in you. You just gotta ignite the light And let it shine Just own the Night Like the Fourth of July You don't have to feel like a waste of space You're original, cannot be replaced If you only knew what the future holds After a hurricane comes a rainbow Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed So you could open one that leads you to the perfect roadLike a lightning bolt, your heart will glow And when it's time, you'll know",
    "It's always around me, all this noise, but Not nearly as loud as the voice saying 'Let it happen, let it happen' (It's gonna feel so good) 'Just let it happen, let it happen All this running around Tryin' to cover my shadow A notion growing inside Now all the others seem shallow All this running around Bearing down on my shoulders I can hear an alarm It must be morning I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound, and When it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on) So let it happen, let it happen",
    "I'm wide awake I'm wide awake I'm wide awake Yeah, I was in the dark I was falling hard With an open heart I'm wide awake How did I read the stars so wrong I'm wide awake And now it's clear to me That everything you see Ain't always what it seems I'm wide awake Yeah, I was dreaming for so long Falling from cloud 9 Crashing from the high I'm letting go tonight (yeah, I'm letting go) I'm Falling from cloud 9 Thunder rumbling Castles crumbling I am trying to hold on God knows that I tried Seeing the bright side But I'm not blind anymore... I'm wide awake I'm wide awake",
    "Not everyone can be like me and Michael The only problem is forgetting which side you're on So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights Like all the rest, but they can't find out In every scene, it's me and Michael Imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds So it seems the danger signs will never let the feelings die When all the best and brightest have gone Me and Michael Solid as they come Me and Michael It's not a question now It's me and Michael",
    "I know of one company that, in the late 80s,wrote a killer app. It was very popular, and lots of professionals bought and used it. But then therelease cycles began to stretch. Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next. Load times grew and crashes increased. I remember the day I shut the product down in frustration and never used it again. The company went out of business a short time after that.",

    "When you were standing in the wake of devastation When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying, 'Save me now' You were there, impossibly alone Do you feel cold and lost in desperation? You build up hope, but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration And let it go Let it go And in a burst of light that blinded every angel As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars You felt the gravity of tempered grace, falling into empty space No one there to catch you in their arms Do you feel cold and lost in desperation? You build up hope, but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration And let it go Let it go"
